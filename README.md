**Project Title:**
🍵 NYC Gregorys Coffee sales dashboard 
- A dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and compare sales trends across products, categories, and locations for Gregorys Coffee’s key NYC stores.

**Project Purpose:**
- The dashboard analyzes HY2023 sales performance to support the marketing team in designing data-driven campaigns aimed at increasing customer reach and retention.
Insights are derived from ~150,000 transactions collected over a six-month period across multiple store locations.

- Store Locations Analyzed -
  - Lower Manhattan: Primarily corporate professionals and high-income workers from finance, banking, consulting, legal, and technology sectors.
  - Hell’s Kitchen: Young professionals, creatives, and nightlife-driven customers from media, entertainment, theater, and hospitality industries.
  - Astoria: Families, long-term residents, and local professionals with community-driven purchasing behavior.

**Business problem:**
Gregorys Coffee experienced lukewarm sales performance in 2022 while competing against major brands such as Starbucks and Dunkin.
Starbucks, in particular, benefits from wider store coverage and higher foot traffic, resulting in stronger sales performance.

**Goal of dashboard**
Management aimed to identify key strengths, demand patterns, and growth opportunities by analyzing HY2023 sales trends.
The objective was to use these insights to strategize and implement targeted marketing initiatives for the second half of the year, focusing on both customer acquisition and retention.

- **Product Basket Depth (Items per Order)** – Evaluates cross-sell effectivenes
- **Revenue Concentration Risk (Top Product Dependency)** – Identifies dependence on top-selling SKUs
- **Sales Volatility (Standard Deviation)** – Measures day-to-day sales fluctuations

**Business Impact & Insights – Marketing Optimization**

**- Strong Dependence on Morning Sales Window :**
  Approximately **55.56%** of total revenue is generated during morning hours, with peak sales occurring between **7 AM and 11 AM** across all locations. 
  Sales decline significantly after this window.

  Marketing Optimization
- Introduce morning loyalty boosters such as double reward points before **11 AM** to convert first-time customers into regulars.
- Launch mid-day promotional offers to increase footfall and reduce dependency on morning demand.
- Target corporate employees and college students during mid-day hours by offering free Wi-Fi and a “happy hour” menu with select items at discounted prices, positioning stores as productive work and study spaces.
- Diversify menu options by including iced drinks, hot chocolate, and herbal / caffeine-free teas to target non-coffee drinkers and increases evening relevance.
  
  
**- Revenue Concentration Around Core Products:**
  The top 5 products contribute **51.35%** of total sales, indicating high reliance on a small set of SKUs.
  
  Marketing Optimization
- Use best-selling products as anchor SKUs to bundle slower-moving categories (e.g., coffee + bakery or coffee + drinking chocolate), encouraging product discovery without discounting core items.
- Introduce limited-time variants of top-performing products (flavor infusions, seasonal recipes) to drive repeat purchases while leveraging existing demand and minimizing cannibalization risk.
- Seasonal menu innovation using fruits such as kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, and mangoes to launch milkshakes, coolers, or iced beverages, expanding non-core product adoption during warmer months.
- Day-specific product spotlight strategy (e.g., “Bakery Wednesday” or “Cold Brew Friday”) with light incentives (5–10%) to nudge customers toward trying non-bestseller items and diversify revenue across SKUs.

**- Moderate Basket Depth Indicates Cross-Sell Opportunity:** 
  The average items per order is 1.44, suggesting that most customers purchase only one or two items per visit.

  Marketing Optimization
- Introduce structured combo bundles (e.g., coffee + sandwich or coffee + bakery) with light price incentives to encourage multi-item purchases without eroding margins.
- Contextual point-of-sale prompts such as “Add a croissant for $X” or “Upgrade to a combo”, triggered during order placement to nudge add-on behavior.
- Time-based cross-sell offers, promoting food pairings during peak morning hours and snack-focused bundles during mid-day and evening periods.
- Location-specific bundle design, aligning combinations with local customer profiles (corporate breakfast combos in Lower Manhattan, snack or family bundles in Astoria).
- Visual menu engineering, using menu boards and digital displays to highlight best-selling pairings and recommended add-ons rather than listing products in isolation.


**- Consistent Spend Per Transaction Across Weekdays & Weekends:** 
  Weekday and weekend average order value is nearly identical (~50/50), indicating that revenue differences are driven by foot traffic rather than basket size.
  Focus weekend campaigns on increasing visits, not upselling.

Marketing Optimization
- Drive repeat weekend visits through frequency-based incentives, such as “Buy on 3 weekends, get 1 free coffee”, to build habitual weekend behavior without relying on heavy discounts.
- Community-driven weekend engagement initiatives, including monthly evening music gigs or themed weekend events, to position stores as social destinations rather than purely transactional stops.
- Event-aligned marketing during major sports weekends (e.g., baseball and rugby) using paid local promotions and targeted ads to capture high footfall from nearby sports venues and viewing hotspots.

    
**- Location-Based Performance Differentiation:** 
  Hell’s Kitchen and Astoria outperform Lower Manhattan in total sales contribution, while Lower Manhattan shows untapped potential.
  
  Marketing Optimization
- Corporate group incentives and breakfast subscriptions in Lower Manhattan, offering group-based rewards when employees visit together, encouraging higher weekday footfall from nearby offices.
- Experience-led evening and late-night positioning in Hell’s Kitchen, including extended store hours and pre-/post-Broadway show coffee specials or late-evening beverage menus aligned with entertainment schedules.
- Family-focused weekend initiatives in Astoria, such as family brunch menus and community-oriented events, to increase visit frequency among residents and local households.


**- Forecast-Driven Campaign Planning:** 
  The 30-day sales forecast indicates a stable upward trend with clear weekly seasonality.

  Marketing Optimization
- Schedule targeted promotions during forecasted demand dips.
- Use forecast insights to optimize inventory planning and workforce allocation.
- Enable proactive, data-driven decision-making for upcoming marketing cycles.
