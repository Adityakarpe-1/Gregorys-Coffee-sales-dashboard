**Project Title:**
🍵 NYC Gregorys Coffee sales dashboard 
- A dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and compare sales trends across products, categories, and locations for Gregorys Coffee’s key NYC stores.

**Project Purpose:**
- The dashboard analyzes HY2023 sales performance to support the marketing team in designing data-driven campaigns aimed at increasing customer reach and retention.
Insights are derived from ~150,000 transactions collected over a six-month period across multiple store locations.

- Store Locations Analyzed -
  - Lower Manhattan: Primarily corporate professionals and high-income workers from finance, banking, consulting, legal, and technology sectors.
  - Hell’s Kitchen: Young professionals, creatives, and nightlife-driven customers from media, entertainment, theater, and hospitality industries.
  - Astoria: Families, long-term residents, and local professionals with community-driven purchasing behavior.

**Business problem:**
Gregorys Coffee experienced lukewarm sales performance in 2022 while competing against major brands such as Starbucks and Dunkin.
Starbucks, in particular, benefits from wider store coverage and higher foot traffic, resulting in stronger sales performance.

**Goal of dashboard**
Management aimed to identify key strengths, demand patterns, and growth opportunities by analyzing HY2023 sales trends.
The objective was to use these insights to strategize and implement targeted marketing initiatives for the second half of the year, focusing on both customer acquisition and retention.

**Business KPI analysed**

- **Product Basket Depth (Items per Order)** – Evaluates cross-sell effectivenes
- **Revenue Concentration Risk (Top Product Dependency)** – Identifies dependence on top-selling SKUs
- **Sales Volatility (Standard Deviation)** – Measures day-to-day sales fluctuations

**Business Impact & Insights – Marketing Optimization**

**- Strong Dependence on Morning Sales Window :**
  Approximately 55.56% of total revenue is generated during morning hours, with peak sales occurring between 7 AM and 11 AM across all locations. 
  Sales decline significantly after this window.

  Marketing Optimization
- Introduce morning loyalty boosters such as double reward points before 11 AM to convert first-time customers into regulars.
- Launch mid-day promotional offers to increase footfall and reduce dependency on morning demand.  
  
**- Revenue Concentration Around Core Products:**
  The top 5 products contribute 51.35% of total sales, indicating high reliance on a small set of SKUs.
  
  Marketing Optimization
- Use top products as anchor items to bundle slower-moving categories such as bakery and drinking chocolate.
- Introduce limited-time variations of bestsellers to drive repeat purchases without cannibalization.

  **- Moderate Basket Depth Indicates Cross-Sell Opportunity:** 
  The average items per order is 1.44, suggesting that most customers purchase only one or two items per visit.

  Marketing Optimization
- Introduce combo pricing (e.g., coffee + sandwich + bakery).
- Implement point-of-sale prompts such as “Add a croissant for $X” to increase basket size.

**- Consistent Spend Per Transaction Across Weekdays & Weekends:** 
  Weekday and weekend average order value is nearly identical (~50/50), indicating that revenue differences are driven by foot traffic rather than basket size.

Marketing Optimization
- Focus weekend campaigns on increasing visits, not upselling.
- Run initiatives such as flat discounts on first weekend visits, “Buy on 3 weekends, get 1 free coffee,” and Sunday brunch-focused offers.

**- Location-Based Performance Differentiation:** 
  Hell’s Kitchen and Astoria outperform Lower Manhattan in total sales contribution, while Lower Manhattan shows untapped potential.
  Marketing Optimization
- Introduce corporate breakfast subscriptions in Lower Manhattan.
- Deploy event-driven and evening promotions in Hell’s Kitchen.
- Promote family-oriented weekend bundles in Astoria to increase transaction frequency.

**- Forecast-Driven Campaign Planning:** 
  The 30-day sales forecast indicates a stable upward trend with clear weekly seasonality.

  Marketing Optimization
- Schedule targeted promotions during forecasted demand dips.
- Use forecast insights to optimize inventory planning and workforce allocation.
- Enable proactive, data-driven decision-making for upcoming marketing cycles.
